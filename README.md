# Flower-Iris-Classification #
Welcome to the Flower Iris Classification project, a comprehensive application of machine learning using Python programming. The primary objective of this project is the classification of Iris flowers using various machine learning algorithms, implemented with scikit-learn tools. The algorithms employed encompass both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

# Algorithms Used
* Random Forest
* K Nearest Classifier
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* Metrics
* Train-Test Split
These algorithms collectively contribute to predicting and evaluating accuracy in the Iris flower classification. The use of familiar machine learning subparts makes this project accessible and understandable for beginners in the field.

# Iris Dataset
The project leverages the Iris Dataset, a well-known dataset widely used for machine learning purposes. It includes measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for three species of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
